Brackets Workspaces
===================

Are you not tired of having to use the "New Brackets Window" button every time you start Brackets?
Have you never dreamed of being able to open Brackets and have all your windows opened in only 2 clicks??
With Brackets Workspaces you will forget this button ever existed and live your dream!

This extension defines a "workspace" as a set of windows to be opened.

Note
